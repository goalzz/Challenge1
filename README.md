# Horiseon - Official Website


## Description 

This is the official website for Horiseon - Digital Solution, showcasing services that are related to Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing.


## Changes Made

In this code, several improvements and modifications have been made to enhance the website's structure and accessibility. Here's a summary of the changes that I made:

**Title**: Changed the title to a more descriptive title, "Horizon - Official Website".

**Header Element**: Replaced the < div > element with a semantic < header > element to signify the website header.

**Heading**: Enhanced the main heading within the header by providing a more descriptive title, "Horiseon - Digital Solution."

**Image Alt Attributes**: Added descriptive alt attributes to all image elements for accessibility and deleted an unnecessary < /img> since the < img > tag is a self-closing element. 

**Footer Element**: Replaced the < div > element with a semantic < footer > element for the website footer.
